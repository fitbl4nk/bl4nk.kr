Introduction\nI mostly use pwntools for solving pwnable challenges, and gdb for debugging.\nIn general I had to run a process and attach to the process in another terminal, but I could automate this procedure in python code with pwntools and tmux.\n\n0x01. Debugging with pwntools\n\nAttach process\nThe attach function of gdb module in pwntools lets us attach to a running process.\n\nIf gdb script was given to the second argument, making breakpoints and running continue can also be automated.\n\nSet terminal\nWe can set where to display the attached debugger.\nThe terminal variable of context module decides where and how to display, you can choose whatever you want.\n\nUsing tmux is old-fashioned, but still powerful. You should note that the python code should be run after tmux session was opened. (refer to Troubleshooting.)\n\n0x02. Conclusion\nFor now I’m using the following code as a template for pwnable.\n\nThere are three arguments given to main function.\nFirst, if -p or --port was given, it uses remote to connect to the server and if not, it attaches local process.\n\nAnd if debugging is not needed anymore, give -d or --debug option and set 0 like the following. Then it will execute without debugging.\n\nFor sending payload to the actual server, give -s or --server option and set the domain or IP address of the server, without debugging.\n\nFYI, the reason for importing the functions related to the packing again after from pwn import * is simply because vscode couldn’t find the definition of these functions for no reason.\n\n0x03. Troubleshooting\n\nTmux session error\nThis error occurred when I ran the code for the first time.\n\nAt first, I thought the error was something to do with the type of the pid because it occurred in gdb.attach(s, gs) and was ValueError, but it was a completely different problem.\nThis error occurs because there is no existing tmux session, though the code creates a terminal in a tmux session.\nI thought it would make one if there isn’t :p\n\n","description":"How to attach a debugger to a process with python code","id":"https://bl4nk.kr/blog/attaching-to-gdb-with-pwntools/","path":"/blog/attaching-to-gdb-with-pwntools/","title":"Attaching to gdb with pwntools"},"https://bl4nk.kr/blog/codegate-2019-ctf-quals-cg-casino/":{"body":"Only available in Korean for now ;)\n","description":"Codegate 2019 CTF Quals pwnable challenge","id":"https://bl4nk.kr/blog/codegate-2019-ctf-quals-cg-casino/","path":"/blog/codegate-2019-ctf-quals-cg-casino/","title":"Codegate 2019 CTF Quals -

Vulnerability\n\nThe first thing I noticed was a BOF occurs in variable s, which is stored in ebp-0x128.\nBut the canary still needs to be bypassed as mentioned.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was the condition of the for loop.\nSince the file array is 32 bytes and the condition is i &lt;= 32, in the last loop, file[32] points to the lowest byte of fd.\n\n0x02. Exploit\nThe problem that arise when fd is overwritten by exploiting the above vulnerailities are as follows.\n\nThe fd that was holding file descriptor opened by open() is changed to a strange value.\nThere could be 2 options. One is to overwrite fd with 0 and input stdin; and the other is  to overwrite fd with a strange value so that no value will be written to canary_backup.\nTherefore, if I cover fd with a strange value and put 0x00000000 in the local variable canary, I can pass mcmcmp().\n\nNow I tried to execute shell via shellcode, since the NX bit was off.\nBut there was no point to leak stack address.\nI found the stack leak technique using the environ variable in libc, so I used this one for the exploit.\nOf course, using ROP is another solution, so I also wrote payload using mprotect().\n\n0x03.

Introduction\nThe SECCOMP (SECure COMPuting mode) is a feature of Linux kernel that provides sandboxing of process.\nIn detail, it restricts the syscalls that are executed in the process, and terminates the process (SIGKILL) if a syscall is not allowed one.\nUnlike other mitigations, it is not applied at compile time, but rather at run time.\nIt seems that it was activated through the value of the /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/seccomp in the past, but it had been changed to be set through prctl or sys_seccomp.(I don’t know since when…)\nIn this post, I will describe the SECCOMP using the prctl function.\n\n0x01. prctl function\n\nThe prctl function is a function for managing the properties of processes or threads (PRocess ConTroL).\nIn addition to applying SECCOMP, which will be explained in detail, it can be used to obtain the process name or the endian information.\nBasically it receives a variable number of arguments and operates according to the desired action.\n\nIn the prctl.h, you can check the values of the macros that go into the first argument, option.\nAmong them, let’s take a closer look at PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS and PR_SET_SECCOMP, which are related to the SECCOMP.\n\nPR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS\n\nThe example above sets the no_new_privs property of the current process as value.\nThis property can be checked in the NoNewPrivs field of /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status since the Linux kernel 4.10.\nIf the value of this property is set to 1, the current process and it’s child processes cannot execute codes that grant new privileges.\nHowever, they can still execute codes that revoke privileges.\nThe importance of this property will be described in the SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER part.\n\nPR_SET_SECCOMP\n\nNow, we come to the actual control of SECCOMP, which has two modes.\n\nIn the seccomp.h, each mode is defined as a macro.\n\nSECCOMP_MODE_STRICT\nIn this mode, only four syscalls are allowed: read, write, exit, and sigreturn. The third argument is not necessary because the available syscalls are already defined.\n\nAs a result of compiling and executing the code above, SIGKILL occurred in open like the following.\n\n\nSECCOMP_MODE_FILTER\nThis is a mode that the user builds a rule set to block certain syscalls.\nThe filter mode can be executed only when no_new_privs property is set via the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS.\nThe rule set is an assembly-like syntax called Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), which will be covered in detail in the seccomp-tools section.\nThe following is an example code of filtering out write syscalls.\n\nAs a result of compiling and executing the code above, SIGSYS occurred in open like the following.\n\nI tried to debug the process because it printed a different message from the SIGKILL message of the strict mode, and I found that the process was terminated by SIGSYS in filter mode.\n\n0x03. seccomp-tools\nLooking at the example code of SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, you need to change the filtering rule into bytecodes and put them in the filter array.\nHowever, even if you are an expert, it is difficult to freely convert the desired BPF rule into bytecodes.\nIn this case, seccomp-tools is a good tool to use.\n\nYou can install seccomp-tools like the above.\n\nAs you can see in the usage, there are commands like asm, disasm, dump, and emu.\n\nasm\nThis command converts BPF rules written like the following to bytecodes.\n\nThe variable A appeared out of nowhere, so I wondered what it was at first, but it’s easier to think of it as just a variable.\nNow, you can save this content as a file and pass it to the argument of seccomp-tools.\n\nAs you can see from the example above, you can output the results in various formats. The -f option provides ready-to-use formats such as raw, c_array, c_source, and assembly.\n\ndisasm\nThe opposite command of asm. It converts BPF in bytecode format to filtering rules.\nYou can give the file where the bytecodes are saved as an input file as an argument.\n\nBy pipelining the asm command, you can check whether the BPF rule is written correctly.\n\ndump\nThis is a command that outputs the BPF rules applied within the binary.\nI looked up how it works out of curiosity, and it seems to analyze the binary dynamically using ptrace.\nHowever, since it prints the rules based on the first prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it may be different from the actual result if the prctl function was called multiple times.\nIn that case, you can increase the number of prctl functions to be checked by giving the -l or --limit option.\nYou can also give the -p or --pid option to check the rules applied to the running process.\n\nYou can use the dump command like this.\n\nemu\nThe emu is a good command to check whether syscalls are properly called or blocked by emulating rule sets.\nWhen ran in bash, the output is colored and easy to check.\n\n\n\n0x04. Expected Vulnerability\nOf course, it depends on how it was coded, but I thought about vulnerabilities that could occur easily.\n\nx32 Syscall\nIn the previous example of disasm command in seccomp-tools, there were rules like these.\n\nThe 0001 line is the logic to check if the architecture is X86_64, then why does it check if the sys_number of the 0003 line is greater than 0x40000000?\nThe reason is the compatibility of the X86_64 architecture.\nIt was developed for the instructions used in the previous 32-bit to be also used in the 64-bit architecture, and this whole concept is called the x32 ABI.\nTherefore, 32-bit syscalls can be called in the 64-bit architecture, and the method for doing so is to add 0x40000000 to the 64-bit syscall number in Linux.\nLet’s look at the code of the do_syscall_x32 function that is called when a 32-bit syscall is actually called in the Linux kernel.\n\nIn the first line of the function, xnr = nr - __X32_SYSCALL_BIT is executed, and the __X32_SYSCALL_BIT value is predefined value 0x40000000.\nTherefore, if there is no logic to verify that the syscall number is less than 0x40000000 in the BPF rule of a 64-bit binary, even if a specific syscall is blocked, you can still call the syscall of the 32-bit architecture by adding 0x40000000 to the syscall number using the x32 ABI.\n\nFilter Overwrite\nThe simplest idea that comes to mind is that it is a vulnerability that can occur when the BPF filter rule part in memory can be overwritten with a desired value before SECCOMP is set. There are ways to do this, such as changing the rule to allow calling the desired syscall, or overwriting the rule with return ALLOW.\nThere is a related challenge on dreamhack.io, which I recommend trying.\n\nSECCOMP Bypass\nI found out while using PR_SET_SECCOMP that if the BPF rule is slightly wrong, the prctl function only returns an error and does not terminate the process.\n\nHere is an example of a wrong BPF rule. If you look closely, you will see that it says goto 0005 on line 0001.\nWhen composing wrong.txt, I thoughtlessly set line of goto as 3 where return KILL is located, but I found out that I had to calculate the line as a relative address.\nFor example, if goto 0 is on the current line 0001, it is interpreted as going to the next line, 0002; and if it’s goto 1, it is interpreted as going to the next next line, 0003. So goto 3 becomes a command to go to line 0005.\nSince line 0005 does not exist in wrong.txt, an error occurs when passing it as an option to prctl.\n\nWhen the wrong rule is applied, a SECCOMP error occurs like this.\nAs a result, the rule that was supposed to block the write syscall was not applied, so the input string was output to STDOUT.\nTherefore, even if the entire filter cannot be overwritten like Filter Overwrite, if the rule itself can be made nonsensical with a few bytes, an error will occur, but the process will be maintained, so SECCOMP bypass is possible.\n\n0x05.
